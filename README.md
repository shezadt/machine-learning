## Description

I implement some machine learning models and algorithms from scratch in python
in order to better understand the underlying concepts.

## Implementations

### Supervised Learning

- [Gaussian Naive Bayes](src/supervised/gaussian_naive_bayes.py)
- [K Nearest Neighbors](src/supervised/k_nearest_neighbors.py)
- [Linear Regression](src/supervised/linear_regression.py)

### Unsupervised Learning

- [K-Means](src/unsupervised/k_means.py)
- [Principal Component Analysis](src/unsupervised/principal_component_analysis.py)
